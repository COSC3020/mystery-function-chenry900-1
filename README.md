# Mystery Function

What does the `mystery()` function in the following piece of code do? Add your
answer to this markdown file.

```javascript
function mystery(a) {
    if(a.length == 1) return a[0];
    var foo = mystery(a.slice(1, a.length))
    if(foo > a[0]) return foo;
    else return a[0];
}
```

This function finds the highest number in the array a by using recursive calls to make the array smaller and smaller until it gets the biggest number in the array.
